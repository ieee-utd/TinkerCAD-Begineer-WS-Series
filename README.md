# TinkerCAD-Begineer-WS-Series
This repo contains all the beginner level workshop series we had for TinkerCAD for Fall 2020

Each code segment has a corresponding circuit design. 

You are able to dowload the code and upload it into TinkerCAD to simulate your design. Follow the circuit image for wiring.
